# OryUI
OryUI is a UI framework to be used with AGK2 (AppGameKit). It's a work in progress.

With it you can create the following UI components:

* Buttons
* Cards (Simple cards, with title and subtitle)
* Lists (1 or 2 line lists with left and right text, and left thumbnail images if required)

It also contains a number of sprite and text functions including a number of 'pin sprite to' and 'pin text to', as well as a WrapText function.

OryUI at the moment is set to work best with percentage based positioning and sizing. The aim is to eventually have it work just as well with pixel based positioning and sizing.

Because it's in a very early stage of development it's probably not a good idea to use it in a live app. How components are called and displayed will likely change. To reduce the chance of a new version breaking your app I'd recommend just playing around with it in some test projects until things are more settled.

## Installation
To include it in your project add the following line to the top of your script

#insert "OryUI.agc"

The above insert line is based on the OryUI.agc file being placed in your project folder. You will need to change the insert path if you place the file somewhere else.

A copy of AGK2 is required to use OryUI. https://www.appgamekit.com

This is the first framework I've attempted to create so any feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticsm will be greatly appreciated.
