# OryUI
OryUI is a GUI framework to be used with AGK2 (AppGameKit). It's a work in progress.

With it you can create the following UI components:

* Buttons
* Cards (Simple cards, with title and subtitle)
* Lists (1 or 2 line lists with left and right text, and left thumbnail images if required)

It also contains a number of sprite and text functions including a number of 'pin sprite to' and 'pin text to', as well as a WrapText function.

A copy of AGK2 is required. https://www.appgamekit.com
