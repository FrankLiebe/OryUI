# OryUI
OryUI is a GUI framework to be used with AGK2 (AppGameKit). It's a work in progress.

With it you can create the following UI components:

* Buttons
* Cards (Simple cards, with title and subtitle)
* Lists (1 or 2 line lists with left and right text, and left thumbnail images if required)

It also contains a number of sprite and text functions including a number of 'pin sprite to' and 'pin text to', as well as a WrapText function.

OryUI at the moment is set to work best with percentage based positioning and sizing. The aim is to eventually have it work just as well with pixel based positioning and sizing.

A copy of AGK2 is required to use OryUI. https://www.appgamekit.com
